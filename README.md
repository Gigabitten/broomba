First and foremost, huge thanks to the Dustforce community Discord, both for exceptional technical knowledge and having no shortage of patience with me at times. 
Credit for the name goes to Skyhawk. Came up with it almost instantly. Absolute mad genius.
Thanks to msg555 for a modified game which can accept input without being the focused window. 
Special thanks to Skyhawk for talking with me for literally hours, helping me work out how to approach getting input and output to and from Dustforce.
